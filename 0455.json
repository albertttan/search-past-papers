(a) what is meant by economic growth?  [2]  (b) explain why firms aim to maximise profits. [4]  (c) describe how lending by commercial banks can have a significant impact on an economy.

(a)  define the term \u2018gross domestic product\u2019.     [3]  (b)  (i)  give one example of each of the three industrial sectors.  [3]   (ii) explain whether the change in the industrial sectors in pakistan mentioned in the extract is the one normally expected to occur as a country develops.  [3]  (c)  explain how the use of monetary policy, through lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply, could be used to stimulate the rate of economic growth in a country.  [5]  (d)  discuss whether other policies, apart from monetary policy, might be more successful in raising the rate of economic growth in pakistan.  [6]",

(a) what is the difference between labour and enterprise? [4]  (b) explain why farmers should consider opportunity cost when deciding how to use their factors  of production.   [4]  (c) using a production possibility curve diagram, analyse the effect of a decrease in the supply of  labour and enterprise on an economy.   [5]  (d) discuss whether an increase in the quality of a country\u2019s factors of production will always  increase its exports.   [7] 3 the equilibrium price of food has changed considerably in recent years. whilst food in general has  an inelastic demand, some types of food have elastic demand. to try to reduce food prices, some governments have introduced measures designed to shift the supply curve to the right.  (a) describe what determines \u2018equilibrium price\u2019.   [2]  (b) explain two reasons why the supply curve of a product may shift to the right.   [4]  (c) analyse what effect a fall in price may have on a farmer\u2019s profit.   [6]  (d) discuss whether the price of food is likely to increase in the future.   [8] 4 nollywood, the nigerian film (movie) industry, is growing in size. more actors are being employed  but their wages are currently still low. wages and other costs of production may alter as the firms in the industry increase further in size. consumers may also be affected by the growth in the size of the firms.   (a) describe how fixed costs and variable costs are influenced by a rise in output.   [2]  (b) explain two reasons why someone may be prepared to work for a low wage.   [4]  (c) analyse two ways a bank can help a firm increase in size.   [4]  (d) discuss, using the nigerian film (movie) industry as an example, whether consumers will  benefit from larger firms.

(a) explain what is meant by a fall in the rate of inflation.   [2]  (b) explain what can cause an increase in the costs of production.   [3]  (c) analyse why a reduction in the rate of interest may cause inflation.   [6]  (d) discuss whether inflation harms everyone in an economy.   [9] 6 living standards vary between countries. this is due, in part, to differences in productivity and the  amount of foreign investment the countries can attract.  (a) identify four characteristics of a developed country.   [4]  (b) explain two measures of living standards.   [4]  (c) analyse how a rise in productivity may increase living standards.   [4]  (d) discuss whether developed countries are likely to attract more foreign investment than  developing countries.   [8] 7 between 2011 and 2012 russia\u2019s exchange rate was relatively constant. the country continued  to have a surplus on the current account of its balance of payments. the main change in its international trade position arose from it joining the world trade organisation. in order to do this, the government agreed to move towards free trade.  (a)   describe what is meant by a current account surplus.   [4]  (b)   analyse why a country\u2019s exchange rate may rise in value.

(a) using information from the extract, explain whether the average cost of building the largest  container ships in china rose or fell between 2012 and 2013. [2]  (b) explain what type of business organisation the extract suggests the two large south korean  shipbuilding firms are. [2]  (c) using information from the extract, explain two external costs that shipbuilding can cause.  [4]  (d) calculate how many more people were unemployed in china than in south korea in 2013.    [3]  (e) analyse two reasons, referred to in the extract, why shipbuilding is declining in the uk. [4]  (f) discuss whether a merger between two shipbuilding firms will improve the quality of ships  built. [5]  (g) using information from the extract, explain whether the value of the south korean won was  expected to rise or fall in 2014. [4]  (h) discuss whether a government should protect its country\u2019s shipbuilding industry. [6]",

(a) giving an example, define \u2018complements\u2019. [2]  (b) explain two reasons why demand for a product may be price-inelastic. [4]  (c) using a demand and supply diagram, analyse the effect of a rise in the price of coffee on the  market for tea. [6]  (d) discuss whether improving the quality of the coffee that a country produces will result in a  surplus on the current account of its balance of payments. [8] 3 an increasing number of pakistani firms are employing managers educated at the country\u2019s  universities. pakistan\u2019s universities are also increasing the number of entrepreneurs in the country. every entrepreneur and every manager faces a number of challenges including raising finance, sometimes by borrowing. some entrepreneurs and managers also negotiate with trade unions. these organisations can influence a country\u2019s economic growth rate.  (a) identify two risks that entrepreneurs have to bear. [2]  (b) explain two reasons why firms may prefer to employ local managers rather than foreign  managers. [4]  (c) analyse why households and firms may borrow more during times of rapid economic growth.     [6]   (d) discuss whether the activities of trade unions are likely to increase or decrease a country\u2019s  economic growth rate. [8] 4 in china, a smaller proportion of women are now dying in childbirth and more infants are surviving.  these improvements have been the result of better care at birth, countrywide immunisation and improved living standards. the government has offered subsidies to mothers who give birth in hospitals. this has increased the quality of care received and made it easier to give vaccinations to babies to protect them against illnesses and diseases.  (a) identify two influences on a country\u2019s birth rate. [2]  (b) explain two measures of comparative living standards. [4]  (c) analyse the social benefits of giving vaccinations. [6]  (d) discuss whether health care should be provided by the public sector or the private sector. [8]",

(a) identify two reasons why people may keep some of their money in a savings account at a  commercial bank. [2]  (b) explain the different goals that state-owned commercial banks and privately-owned  commercial banks may have. [4]  (c) analyse how the growth in the size of commercial banks may benefit their customers. [6]  (d) discuss whether living standards are likely to be higher in a mixed economy or a market  economy. [8] 6 in 2014 brazil\u2019s inflation rate was increasing while its unemployment rate was falling. in that year  spending by the government increased by 16% while its tax revenue fell by 8%. as a result the country\u2019s budget deficit increased.  (a) what is meant by an inflation rate increasing? [2]  (b) explain two reasons why tax revenue may fall. [4]  (c) analyse how a fall in unemployment may increase inflation. [6]  (d) discuss whether a government should spend more than it raises in taxation. [8] 7 many economists are predicting that relative poverty will increase whilst absolute poverty will fall  in both india and the united states of america. the level of poverty can be influenced by, for example, education, the technology used and the number of new businesses created, including sole proprietorships.  (a) define \u2018absolute poverty\u2019. [2]  (b) explain two different opportunity costs that may be involved in a person becoming a sole  proprietor.

(a) describe the opportunity cost of mauritania exporting fish.  [2]  (b) calculate mauritania\u2019s economic growth rate in 2013.  [3]  (c) using information from the extract, draw a demand and supply diagram to show the effects of  the predicted change in fish stocks on the market for fish.  [4]  (d) state the two parts of a country\u2019s current account balance not identified in the extract.  [2]  (e) analyse two reasons why the average cost of the eu fishing industry is lower than the  mauritanian fishing industry.  [4]  (f) discuss whether a decrease in unemployment will always reduce poverty.

(a) identify two external costs of smoking.  [2]  (b) explain how perfectly inelastic demand differs from inelastic demand.  [4]  (c) analyse two ways, apart from imposing an indirect tax, in which a government could  discourage smoking.  [6]  (d) discuss whether a merger between two large firms in the same industry will increase the  price of the product.

[8] 7 mozambique is a developing economy with a relatively high economic growth rate. in recent years  there has been a depreciation in the value of its currency, the metical, against the us dollar. this has had an influence on the country\u2019s unemployment rate. some economists in mozambique have called for an increase in tariffs on imports to reduce unemployment.

(a) state two functions of local government.  [2]  (b) explain how a lower cost of living can encourage population growth.  [4]  (c) analyse the influences on the mobility of two factors of production.  [6]  (d) discuss whether or not increased investment is beneficial to an economy.  [8] 3 ireland has one of the lowest rates of corporation tax in europe. this has encouraged many  multinational companies (mncs) to produce in ireland. other reasons why firms want to produce  in ireland include access to freer trade with other european countries, higher labour productivity  and government grants.  (a) state two benefits of free trade.  [2]  (b) explain two reasons why governments levy taxes.  [4]  (c) analyse, using a production possibility curve (ppc) diagram, the impact of higher labour  productivity on an economy.  [6]  (d) discuss whether or not mncs always benefit their host countries.  [8] 4 business-friendly fiscal policy in the united states (us) has encouraged firms to produce more.  the us government has also encouraged mergers, including firms in the gas and electricity  industries. even though there are significant regulations, entrepreneurs have found that mergers  enable them to maximise their profits. however, this may make markets less competitive and  some states have imposed a maximum price for gas and electricity.

[8] 3 cyclical unemployment is below the national average in some big cities in canada such as toronto,  vancouver, and montreal. this could be a result of higher government spending and tax cuts in  big cities. however, productivity is low. there are also concerns that structural unemployment may  increase as some industries cannot compete with more efficient foreign firms.
