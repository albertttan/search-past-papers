            "3": "3 0470/23/o/n/16 \u00a9 ucles 2016 [turn over source b garibaldi alone was committed to a united italy from start to finish. napoleon iii was not, cavour was  not. garibaldi is fundamental to the unification process. it was he who forced cavour to embrace  unification. cavour knew nothing of the south and aimed only at an enlarged piedmont. he did not envisage full unification until a much later date, possibly by another generation. garibaldi\u2019s success transformed the situation. cavour was opposed to garibaldi\u2019s expedition and he saw garibaldi\u2019s success as a threat to everything he had achieved. garibaldi had to be stopped and the only way this could be done was to take over the papal states and southern italy. cavour unified italy not because  he believed in a united italy but to stop garibaldi. it was a desperate gamble to preserve an enlarged  piedmont. once he had achieved unification he became a firm supporter of it but he was not its architect. he  was not a planner, he was an opportunist and his schemes succeeded more by luck than design. for  example, the alliance with france was not of his making. unification was forced on him by garibaldi\u2019s  achievements. from a book published in 2001. source c a cartoon published in britain in june 1859. napoleon iii, on the left, is saying to  king victor emmanuel, \u2018bravo, my little fellow! you shall do all the fighting and we\u2019ll divide the  glory.\u2019",
            "4": "4 0470/23/o/n/16 \u00a9 ucles 2016 source d garibaldi is planning the wildest schemes. as he remains devoted to king victor emmanuel, he will not  help mazzini or republicanism. but he feels it is his duty to liberate all italy, stage by stage, before turning  it over to the king. he is thus putting off the day when sicily will demand annexation to piedmont, for  he wants to keep the dictatorial powers which will enable him to raise an army to conquer first naples,  then rome. the government here has no influence on him. we must therefore prevent garibaldi from  conquering naples, and we must try and annex sicily as soon as possible. were garibaldi to become  master of naples we would not be able to stop him from compromising us with france and europe. if  the bourbons have to fall, it should not be by garibaldi\u2019s actions. a letter from cavour to costantino nigra, july 1860. nigra was a piedmontese  diplomat working for cavour in paris. source e as to garibaldi\u2019s expedition to sicily, cavour said exactly these words: \u2018well and good. begin at the  south in order to come north. when it is a question of actions of that kind, however bold they may  be, you can rely on my support.\u2019 those were his precise words. he promised to help the expedition,  provided the part played by the government was completely concealed. giuseppe sirtori speaking in the italian parliament in 1863. sirtori was garibaldi\u2019 s  chief of staff and was with him during his conquest of sicily and naples. he  represented garibaldi in discussions with cavour. source f several times cavour mentioned the possibility of italian unity, and what he said to me was this:  i have always favoured a federal system. i have never recoiled  from the extreme but inevitable result of a federation, namely the   establishment of a republic. after the armistice of villafranca,  however, federalism was no longer possible. so i came to believe  that the only possibility was a unitary and monarchical state. cavour possesses a gift for intrigue and in the last few days he has recovered his lost self-confidence.  the day he throws off the mask to deal openly with the conqueror of the two sicilies, he will put himself  at the head of an all-powerful liberal party. a letter from baron talleyrand, french ambassador at turin, to the french foreign  minister, august 1860.",

            "7": "7 0470/23/o/n/16 \u00a9 ucles 2016 [turn over source b the league appeared to many to offer the best alternative to the balance-of-power approach that had  failed so badly in 1914. but it was not the league that wilson had planned. it was not a substitute  for great-power politics, as he had intended, but rather just additional to it. it always operated within prescribed limits and its success depended on the willingness of the powerful states to use it. the league moved quickly after it was established. the first dispute successfully resolved was between  finland and sweden. it also speedily resolved the conflict between bulgaria and greece. if most of the  league\u2019s successes involved small states, the clash between britain and turkey over oil-rich mosul in  1924 suggested that the council\u2019s procedures could be used to keep the peace in matters involving a great power. the failure over the italian invasion of abyssinia was due to britain and france, rather than the league. nor was the failure of various international conferences such as the world economic conference of  london in 1933 the fault of the league of nations. the framework for international cooperation was still fragile but the activities of the league appeared with the passage of time to be a contribution to the shaping of the contemporary world. the league was a forerunner of a new world order based on international cooperation. it embodied the new ideas that characterised the twentieth century. it is hoped the ideal of world peace \u2013 the ideal of the league \u2013 will become the dominant feature of the  twenty-first century. from a history book published in 2011. source c a british cartoon published in 1920.",

            "9": "9 0470/23/ o/n/20 \u00a9 ucles 2020 [turn over source b the soviets thought that a general improvement in the soviet military position would affect the entire  political context, strengthening their hand for dealing with the whole range of problems facing them.  but even though general rather than specific security goals were the principal motive, the decision over the missiles did offer prospects for specific gains. the soviet leverage on berlin would be improved. nato would be shaken. in latin america, other potential \u2018castros\u2019 would be encouraged. it would also cut the ground from under the chinese communists and convince communists everywhere that soviet leadership was strong. castro clamoured more and more for military protection, magnifying the threat of an american invasion.  installing missiles in cuba would meet castro\u2019s demands, and take advantage of what had become, since castro\u2019s self-proclaimed membership of the communist bloc, the first opportunity to project soviet power into the west. it would also provide a convenient solution to several of their other problems. the  soviet government seems to have decided on putting missiles in cuba as a generalised, strategic  response to a whole set of problems, military, economic and political. from a book by roger hilsman, 1967. hilsman was director of the bureau of intelligence and  research in the american government at the time of the cuban missile crisis.  source c khrushchev and his defence minister, rodion malinovsky, were at khrushchev\u2019s estate on the black  sea. they went for a walk and malinovsky pointed in the direction of turkey and said, \u2018that\u2019s where  the american rockets are pointing at us. they need only 10 minutes to reach our cities, but our rockets  need 25 minutes to reach america.\u2019 khrushchev thought for a while and then said, \u2018why don\u2019t we install rockets in cuba and point them at the americans? then we will need only 10 minutes, too.\u2019  an account by major-general boris surikov, a soviet missiles expert, of a conversation between  khrushchev and his defence minister which took place before the missile crisis. source d we were sure the americans would never reconcile themselves to the existence of castro\u2019s cuba.  one thought kept hammering away at my brain: what would happen if we lose cuba? i knew it would  gravely diminish our stature throughout the world, but especially in latin america. if cuba fell, other latin american countries would reject us. what exactly could we do? the logical answer was missiles. the united states had already surrounded the soviet union with its own missiles. it was during my visit to bulgaria that i had the idea of installing missiles with nuclear warheads in cuba.  i want to make one thing absolutely clear; when we put our missiles in cuba, we had no desire to  start a war. on the contrary, our main aim was only to deter america from starting a war. in addition to protecting cuba, our missiles would have equalised what the west likes to call the \u2018balance of power\u2019. the americans had surrounded our country with military bases and threatened us with nuclear weapons, and now they would learn just what it feels like to have enemy missiles pointing at you. it  was high time america learned what it feels like to have her own land threatened. from khrushchev\u2019s memoirs published in 1970.",
